# push_swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a **set of int values**, **2 stacks** and a **set of instructions to manipulate both stacks**.

2 programs in C:
• The first, named **checker** which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.
• The second one called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.
Easy?
We’ll see about that...

# Usage
`$> checker `

# *TODO*:
**Checker**
- [ ] input validation
- [ ] parser
- [ ] step count

**Sorter**
- [ ] do sorting

**Bonus**
- [ ] console out
- [ ] nice graphic output
