# BASED_BOIS_BASE
This is your nice and clean way to share files between school and home accounts.

Just clone the rep and use the folder with your nickname or make a new one if there isn't any.

-=TO CLONE THE REP=-
```
git clone https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git *dir_name*
cd *dir_name*
ls -o
cd *your_RAP_nickname*
echo KAEF
```

-=TO UPDATE THE OTHERS CHANGES IN THE REP=-
```
git fetch
git pull https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git
echo KAEF
```

-=TO CREATE OWN BRANCH=-
```
git branch *branch_name* // name can be anything
git checkout *branch_name*
echo KAEF
```
Simple as that! Then just continue working as usual with "add-commit-push" as needed.
Remember, you are now pushing to the new branch, you just created.

Rep owner will be able to see your branch and then will be able to merge your changes.
Your branch will also be seen in "BRANCHES" section on GitHub
