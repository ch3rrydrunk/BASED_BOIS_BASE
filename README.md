# BASED_BOIS_BASE
This is your nice and clean way to share files between school and home accounts.

Just clone the rep and use the folder with your nickname or make a new one if there isn't any.

-=TO CLONE THE REP=-
```
git clone https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git *dir_name*
cd *dir_name*
ls -o
cd *your_RAP_nickname*
echo KAEF
```

-=TO UPDATE THE OTHERS CHANGES IN THE REP=-
```
git fetch
git pull https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git
echo KAEF
```

-=TO CREATE OWN BRANCH=-
```
git branch *branch_name*          // name can be anything
git checkout *branch_name*
echo KAEF
```
Simple as that! Then just continue working as usual with "add-commit-push" as needed.
Remember, you are now pushing to the new branch, you just created.

-=TO SUBMIT YOUR BRANCH TO THE MASTER=-
```
git fetch                         // this will update the info on the master on your local machine 
git checkout *your_branch_name*
git pull https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git
> *git will ask your Git Hub login and password here*
echo KAEF
```

Rep owner will be able to see your branch and then will be able to merge your changes.
Your branch will also be seen in "BRANCHES" section on GitHub
